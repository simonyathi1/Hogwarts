# Hogwarts

- This app allows you to view Harry Potter Characters, Houses, and some spells.
- Characters have a character details screen, as do spells, and houses, which also allow you to look only at the characters from that particular house

- I used:
  - Kotlin
  - Coroutines
  - Retrofit
  - Dagger Hilt
  - JetPack's Navigation Component
  - MVVM Pattern
